        <li>Issue - Accessed from Git Hub website; way to set tasks, report progress. Open to start and close when done. </li>
        <li>Staging area - where any changes you have made wait for the next commit. </li>

        <li>pull request- request to merge work done on a separate branch back into the main branch.</li>

        <li>SSH key - An SSH key is an access credential for the secure shell (SSH) network protocol. Generating SSH keys allows developers to interface with certain remote services without having to constantly retype login information.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>ls - list of files and folders in current location.</li>
        <li>cd downloads - (change directory) - in the example it will take us to the downloads folder.</li>
        <li>mkdir new_folder - make a new directory in current location - in the example it will be called new_folder.</li>

        <li>git remote -v - to connect to remote repo.</li>
        <li>code . - to open VSC from current directory.</li>
        <li>git status - view status of branch/commits.</li>

        <li>git add -A - to add all files in the directory to the staging area.</li>
        <li>git pull origin main - pull files from another branch (to make sure you are using the latest version of the code) - here the branch is called main.</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Git Hub Workflows</h3>
        <h4>SSH key setup</h4>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>Use ls -al ~/.ssh to check if any existing SSH keys are present </li>
        <li>If you see a public key ending in .pub e.g. id_rsa.pub, id_ecdsa.pub, id_ed25519.pub - you can skip generating a new SSH key and use your existing keys to add to the SSH agent. </li>
        <li>If you see an error that it doesn't exist, you need to create a new SSH pair </li>
        <li>use ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@gmail.com" to create a new SSH key</li>
        <li>When you are prompted save the key in your default file location and create a secure passphrase </li>
        <li>use eval “$(ssh-agent -s)” to start the SSH agent </li>
        <li>Add your private SSH key to the ssh-agent using the ssh-add command</li>
        <li>Copy the public SSH key to your clipboard. Be sure not to copy anything else after this point so that your SSH key stays on your clipboard! </li>
        <li>Navigate to the GitHub website and log in to your account. </li>
        <li>Click on Settings, and then click on SSH and GPG keys. </li>
        <li>Add your SSH key. </li>
        <li>You may need to add your name using git config --global user.name "yourname" </li>
        <li>You may need to add your email using git config --global user.email "YOUR_EMAIL" </li>
        <li>In your terminal, enter ssh -T git@github.com. Verify that the fingerprint in the message matches the GitHub’s RSA public key fingerprint. If it does, type yes and you should be connected!</li>
        </ol>
        </h4>
        <h4>Basic Github Workflow</h4>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>Find the directory in CLI</li>
        <li>Use Code . to open in VCS</li>
        <li>Use git status in CLI to check branch info</li>
        <li>Use git checkout -b (branch name) to create new feature branch to work on</li>
        <li>Confirm move to new branch with git status</li>
        <li>Make your changes or add code/files to directory</li>
        <li>Use git add -A to add all modifications from the current working branch to the staging area</li>
        <li>Use git commit -m "..." to make the commits from the staging area and describe them</li>
        <li>Use git pull origin main to confirm our branch is still using the latest version of main</li>
        <li>Use git push origin main to push the changes to the remote branch in the cloud.</li>
        <li>Visit Repo in browser and complete pull request</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>To add files/code to project</h4>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>Unzip files to project folder</li>
        <li>Navigate to project folder in CLI</li>
        <li>Use code . to open VSC. New files will automatically show. They are now in the staging area ready to be committed and pushed.</li>
        </ol>
