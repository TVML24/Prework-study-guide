          <h3>Elements - Body</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>&lt;h1&gt;(through to h6) Makes a heading and represents a level of that heading. e.g. h1 appears at the top of the page and should only appear once, headings need to appear in numberical order.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
          <h3>Glossary</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Inline CSS - to style an element directly into the html file. Inline styles apply to a sepcific html tag, using a style attribute with CSS rule to style a particular page element only. Like in text. e.g. to style a heading &lt;h1 style="color: red;&gt; This will only apply to that instance of h1.</li>
              <li>Internal Stylesheet - to embed an entire stylesheet directly into the &lt;head&gt; element. This sheet contains rules for the webpage and applies only to this page. You can configure CSS classes and IDs as you would with an external sheet. A single change to the CSS rule will effect all instances of the element. (example to be insterted)</li>
              <li>External Stylesheet - The most common way to style a website. Preferred because it allows developers to keep all CSS rules in one place which makes design changes easier later on. This require a &lt;link&gt; element inside the &lt;head&gt; element in the html file to the stylesheet. This file must be added to the repo first or the coding will not be reflected.</li>
              <li>CSS rule - made up of a selector that signifies which element it will apply to (e.g. h1 for all instances of h1), a property (e.g. color:) and a value (e.g. blue;).</li>
              <li>CSS box model - visual way of representing how modifying different properties will effect the size of the element overall. (example to be included.)</li>
              <li>(to) designate a class attribute - basically, to make a custom selector for CSS rules.</li>
              <li>.card - The period preceeding card designates it as a class selector. Any html element assigned to this class will gain the assignment designated to it by the CSS stylesheet. (provide an example)</li>
            </ul>
          <h3>CSS Properties</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Margin: 0; - This designates a margin of zero. A margin is the space we want outside of the element.</li>
              <li>Padding: 0; - This designates a padding of zero. Padding is space left free inside of the element. If you increase padding it will make the whole element bigger.</li>
              <li>Background-color: blue; - This designates the background colour of the element as blue.</li>
              <li>colour: blue; - This designates the element should be blue.</li>
              <li>text-align: center; - This designates that the text alignment should be centered.</li>
              <li>text-decoration: underline; This designates that the text should be underlined.</li>
              <li>display: block; - Instructs each image to start on a new line.</li>
            </ul>
          <h3>CSS Selectors</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Wild card symbol (*) - declares that all emements on the page will have the following CSS properties.</li>
            </ul>
          <h3>CSS Values</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>width: 80%; - instructs that the computer should use 80% of the available width.</li>
              <li>margin: 40px auto; - instructs that the margin should be 40px at the top and bottom and the auto value applied to the left and right.</li>
              <li>border: 5px solid gray; - instructs that a border should be created with a width of 5px and be solid gray in colour.</li>
              <li>box-shadow: 5px 10px #888888; - instructs that shadows should be added around the elements frame. In this example 5px is the offset on the x-axis relative to the element, 10px is the offset on the y-axis relative to the element and #888888 is the colour defined by a html hexadecimal code. This affect could also include blur and spread radius, but here they are not defined.</li>

            <h4>SSH key setup</h4>
              <ol type="1">
                <li>Use ls -al ~/.ssh to check if any existing SSH keys are present </li>
                <li>If you see a public key ending in .pub e.g. id_rsa.pub, id_ecdsa.pub, id_ed25519.pub - you can skip generating a new SSH key and use your existing keys to add to the SSH agent. </li>
                <li>If you see an error that it doesn't exist, you need to create a new SSH pair </li>
                <li>use ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@gmail.com" to create a new SSH key</li>
                <li>When you are prompted save the key in your default file location and create a secure passphrase </li>
                <li>use eval “$(ssh-agent -s)” to start the SSH agent </li>
                <li>Add your private SSH key to the ssh-agent using the ssh-add command</li>
                <li>Copy the public SSH key to your clipboard. Be sure not to copy anything else after this point so that your SSH key stays on your clipboard! </li>
                <li>Navigate to the GitHub website and log in to your account. </li>
                <li>Click on Settings, and then click on SSH and GPG keys. </li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          <h3>Glossary</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Script - the element in the html document that loads the JavaScript .script file. Must be placed as far down the html coding as possibly; preferably directly before the end of body. e.g. &lt;script src="file destintion/example/main.js&gt; &lt;script&gt; </li>
              <li>Array - an ordered collection of data that allows multiple values in a single variable. e.g. Var Tim = ["27", "Australian"];. We can then select a value from the array with Tim[0]. Remember that arrayed values are zero-indexed!</li>
              <li>Object - any kind of JavaScript variable.</li>
              <li>Operator - a symbol that produces based on two values or variables. e.g. +, -, x, /. Be careful + as it can add mathematically or combine 2 strings (1+1=11).</li>
              <li>Assignment - a symbol that assigns a variable. e.g. =.</li>
              <li>Strict Equality - a symbol that tests two values for equality and returns a boolean result (true/false). This symbol is ===.</li>
              <li>Not - returns the opposite of the value that would otherwise be returned. e.g. myVariable = 3, buuut !(myVariable === 3). The result is false as ! performs the not operation.</li>
              <li>Does not Equal - tests to see if two values are not equal and returns a boolean result. Opposite of strict equality. e.g. !==.</li>
              <li>Conditional - a code structure that tests if an expression is true or truthy and executes code based on the result. See examples section.</li>
              <li>Function - creates a re-usable function that can be used anywhere in the code. See examples section.</li>
              <li>Event/event handler - listens for activity in the broswer and runs code in response to that activity. e.g. clicking the screen.</li>
              <li>Dynamic typing - vairables in Javascript may be associated with any value type, or reassigned to a different value type e.g. let pineapple = 117;</li>
              <li>Weak typing - Javascript allows for implicit type conversion when an operation involves mismatched value types rather than throwing an error. e.g. foo = 42, foo + 1, return 421 (this is the combination of the two strings).</li>
              <li>Primitive value/immutable - primitive values are values that cannot be changed e.g. null. e.g. changing this value would break JS.</li>
              <li>Null - expresses that a variable points to no object. See examples for intentional usage of null.</li>
              <li>Undefined - expresses the a variable points to no value.</li>
              <li>JavaScript Property - These associate keys with their value. Here keys define the data set and values are the variables that belong to the set. e.g. (Key) FirstName (value) Bugs</li>
              <li>Data Property - A kind of JavaScript property that associates a certain key with a certain kind of value. e.g. value (can be any kind of value), writable (boolean as to whether the property can be assigned (=)), enumerable (boolean value that indicates whether a property can be used in a for...loop), configurable (a boolean value that indicates whether or not a value can be deleted, modified or be changed to an accessor property). </li>
              <li>Accessor Property - a key with one of two accessor functions (get and set) to retrieve or store a value.</li>
              <li>Get - binds an object property to a function that will be called when it is looked up. See example section.</li>
              <li>Set - can be used to define or store a value.</li>
              <li>Method - A Javascript method is a property containing a function definition. </li>
              <li>Argument - Object called arguments work as a local variable available to all function except arrows. This is used to access the parameter that is passed to the function. It can only be accessed inside the function.</li>
              <li>Truthy/Falsy - A value is considered falsy if it is 0, +-0, On, Null, Undefined, NaN, or a boolean false value. All other values including a boolean true are truthy. Conditional (If statements) trigger conditions only if the value is truthy. See examples.</li>
              <li>For loop - Uses a predictable pattern of indicies to perform a task on all the items in the array by allowing a single code block to run over and over again. See examples section.</li>
            </ul>
          <h3>Built-in Functions</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>document.querySelector ("h1"); - selects an element from html. See example section.</li>
              <li>ExampleVariable.textContent - sets the variables of the text content (e.g.) what is the text. See example section. </li>
              <li>alert(); - triggers pop-up in browser. </li>
              <li>return result; instructs the function to return the result of the variable so that it is available to use outside of the variable. </li>
              <li>document.querySelector("html").addEventListener("click", - instructs the event listener to listen for a click anywhere on the html page. </li>
              <li>console.log () - outputs the contents of the parentheses to the console. </li>
              <li>math.floor() - Always rounds down and returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number.</li>
              <li>math.random() - returns a pseudo random number that is greater than or equal to zero and less than one.</li>
              <li></li>

            <ul>
              <li>Separation of concerns - Making the program modular, so that each section is separate and addresses a different "concern". This makes code easier to maintain and develop further, but requires more initial coding to set up.</li>
              <li>D.R.Y code - Don't Repeat Yourself. e.g. rather than make separate lines for header and footer in a CSS stylesheet use a comma to combine the two. e.g. use selector header, footer</li>
              <li>Control Flow - The order in which the computer executes code e.g. in JS it is linear (top to bottom).</li>
