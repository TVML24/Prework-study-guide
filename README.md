# Prework-Study Guide

## Description

The motivation of this project was to act as an introduction into basic coding in the languages of html, CSS and Javascript. The particular design and layout of it reflect a dual purpose, however, of both acting as an exercise for learning, as well as being a functional repository of information that I have learnt through it's construction.
This design, concept and idea reflect a solution to the problem of attaining and retaining large volumes of information (some of which is quite technical) in a small amount of time.
Throughout this process, I have learnt a considerable amount of basic coding in the languages of html and CSS. I have also started the journey towards learning Javascript, which although I am only at the opening stage of, has sparked curiosity in me to learn more.

## Usage

This project contains a list of all of the useful information that was presented during the pre-course work. The information is seperated into sections under sub-headings that should make it easy to lookup and locate knowledge; should it be required later on. 
The console runs a simply script that shows the basic application of Javascript and includes a suggestion of which topic to study based on a random number generator. 
As I have included several extension projects/issues to be implemented to the basic design to give myself further practice, this topic suggester will be useful in making sure that I am not avoiding any aspects of this study.
